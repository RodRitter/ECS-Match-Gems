# Match Gems
This is my attempt at using the [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) architecture when developing a small game.

## Installation & Running
- ` $ npm install http-server -g`
- Navigate to root folder
- `$ http-server`
- Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
